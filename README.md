# Genetic-Algorithm-on-n-Queens
Implement GA methods on 8-Queens, 16-Queens, and 32-Queens problems.
The results should include:
1. Eight solutions for each size n-Queens problem. Totally, there are 24 solutions. You could start the GA randomly, and repeat the process 8 times. You donâ€™t need to check the similarity of the solutions.
